	- Lastseen now handles quits, parts and joins correctly
	- Auto-op'ing of users. Currently maintained in the file. DB interface
	  is planned.
	- Kicks are now shown correctly
	- New functions:
		- Question - Anna^ now responds to any message to her that ends
		  with a ?. She also answers !question <question>
		- Roulette - Or rather... russian roulette. Lose, and you'll 
		  get kicked (provided Anna^has the rights).
		  Type '!roulette' and get shot. Type '!reload' if you're a 
		  weenie.
		- Bash - type !bash #<number> or !bash random and Anna^ returns
		  the corresponding quote (or a random one) from the bash quote
		  database (http://bash.org).
		- Quote - Save quotes and displays random quotes on !quote 
		- Karma - That's right, show the world who/what you like (and 
		  dislike) through this brand new and unoriginal karma system 
		  (work--, anyone?)
		- Fortunes - yep, that's right. If the fortune app is installed
		  and in your path, your can use !fortune
		- Google - search google. Anna^ returns the first result found.
	- New requirements:
		- LWP::UserAgent module is now required as well. It is used for 
		  bash and google functions and will be used for other website-
		  interaction later.
	- Several minor cleanups
	- Fixed !order-bug. !order <item> for <nick> now works correctly
	- Running Anna^ with --help or -h on the command-line now prints usage
	  information
