 == Todo for Anna^ ==
- -P without an argument makes anna prompt for password (safer)
- Logfile
- Parse <int> as range in googlesearch (3 equals hit #3, 1-3 equals #1, #2 & 
  #3). => bjuhn
- Handle Netplits properly (two servers in quit msgs)
- Make colouring work on various terminals...
(- Check if Anna^ is running interactively or not) partly solved.
- Add option to check for voice/op for some commands (notably !add-stuff)
- Rewrite anna and make her use POE::IRC (or whatever it's called) instead
- Do some more error-checking:
 - Check if modules exists before trying to use them.
 - Improve on the colour-checks for redirected output

Features
--------
- Babelfish

Blockers for 0.4
----------------
POE::IRC
Basic authentication based on db
Make it possible to auto-op auth'ed users

Blockers for 0.5
----------------

Command-line interaction
Implement per-network/channel-databases, something like:
~/.anna/anna_$network_$channel.db
We need to use two sets of dbs... a global (per-network) one, that holds user 
information and which users that privmsg can use, and a per-channel one.
Auto-create #channel.anna.db.

Modularization - make anna import all command-functionality from external 
"modules"

Blockers for 1.0
----------------
