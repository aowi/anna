0.20 Sat Sep  2 21:43:07 CEST 2006
	- Lastseen now handles quits, parts and joins correctly
	- Auto-op'ing of users. Currently maintained in the file. DB interface
	  is planned.
	- Kicks are now shown correctly
	- New functions:
		- Question - Anna^ now responds to any message to her that ends
		  with a ?. She also answers !question <question>
		- Roulette - Or rather... russian roulette. Lose, and you'll 
		  get kicked (provided Anna^has the rights).
		  Type '!roulette' and get shot. Type '!reload' if you're a 
		  weenie.
		- Bash - type !bash #<number> or !bash random and Anna^ returns
		  the corresponding quote (or a random one) from the bash quote
		  database (http://bash.org).
		- Quote - Save quotes and displays random quotes on !quote 
		- Karma - That's right, show the world who/what you like (and 
		  dislike) through this brand new and unoriginal karma system 
		  (work--, anyone?)
		- Fortunes - yep, that's right. If the fortune app is installed
		  and in your path, your can use !fortune
		- Google - search google. Anna^ returns the first result found.
	- New requirements:
		- LWP::UserAgent module is now required as well. It is used for 
		  bash and google functions and will be used for other website-
		  interaction later.
	- Several minor cleanups
	- Fixed !order-bug. !order <item> for <nick> now works correctly
	- Running Anna^ with --help or -h on the command-line now prints usage
	  information

0.21 Wed Sep  6 19:29:16 CEST 2006
	- Bugfix - parsing of command-line now works properly!

0.30 Sat Nov 25 19:47:58 CET 2006
	- Anna^ now recovers her nick correctly. Rejoice! (Bug since 0.10).
	- Anna^ catches SIGINT and disconnect properly from irc and the 
	  database.
	- Ircname is now set correctly... blame lame Net::IRC documentation.
	- (internal) trim functions added. Input will now be trimmed for 
	  whitespace.
	- (internal) command-line arguments are now parsed with getopt::long
	- Added check for database file.
	- Experimental color-coding of terminal output. I'm not sure if I'll 
	  keep it. In other news, subroutine warning() now handles warnings and
	  error() make errors a little more spiffy.
	- Improved parsing of HTML source.
	- You can now specify how many results a google search should return.
	  use !google <int> <query>. Otherwise, google will return the first
	  result. A new range-search concept has been added to todo as well.
	- Squashed bug that nix'ed newlines from privmsg output.
	- You no longer get booted from #channel if you lose in a private game
	  of roulette.
	- !fortune now accepts -a, -o and -e as well as a packagename.
	- !lart me makes Anna^ insult YOU!
	- Specify your own trigger. You no longer _have_ to use !. Just change
	  the $trigger variable.
	- Use --silent to suppress all output to the terminal. --verbose still
	  overrides this.
	- No more SQL injection vulnerabilities (hopefully).
	- !google now displays correct number of results.
	- (internal) colour()-routine now handles colourization of strings.
	- Notices are now printed on stdout, unless the --silent flag is used.
	- Nick changes no longer invokes a quit notice.
	- Orders have been moved to the database.
	- Anna^ now checks for the presence of /etc/anna.conf and 
	  ~/.anna/config and uses those two instead of default values.
	  Precedence is as follows: cmd-line > configfiles > default values.
	- Anna^ will now kick users that utter a banned word. You can define
	  banned words in the configuration file.
	- Makefile added - use su -c "make install" to install anna.
	- New first-run check will copy config and db if they aren't present.
	- New anna_init subroutine will take care of initial checks
	- Don't lowercase nicks when nicks are changed (happened due to 
	  lastseen functionality)
	- Handle kills properly (don't appear to be trying to reconnect)
	- More consistency and fewer deadly sins... hooray! \o/
	- Autpdetect database version and update if out of sync
	- (internal) Use constants, not variables for stuff that really are 
	  constant during the session.
	- Output will only be colourized if STDOUT is a tty. This might create
	  a problem with output going to STDERR, but since this _should_ be 
	  sent through error() anyway, I've added a check for STDERR->tty 
	  there.
	- Quoting of messages in lastseen-system fixed.
	- (internal) escape_shell()-function added. Escapes a string for use
	  in a shell environment.
	- Flagparsing i !fortune fixed.
	- New functions:
		- Note - yep, a note-taking system (somewhat). Syntax is 
		  !note <text1> = <text2> where <text1> is a short identifier
		  and <text2> is the note. View a note with !note <text1>.
		  !calc without anything prints a random note.
		- Mynotes - show all notes belonging to yourself, with 
		  !mynotes. Send Anna^ a privmsg to see all if you have more
		  than 15.
		- Rot13 - translate rot13-strings with !rot13 <string>
		- Search - use !search to search various tables in Anna^'s
		  database. So far, you can use 'notes', 'quotes' and 'all'.
		  Syntax is !search <table> <str>.
		- !addorder - add a new order to the database. Syntax is
		  !addorder <key> = <order>, and <order> must contain
		  the string "##".
		- !rstats - print statistical information from roulette games.
	- New requirements:
		- Perl module HTML::Parser (for HTML::Entities)

0.40 Thu May 17 17:02:20 CEST 2007
	- More stable Makefile
	- Altered !search to work with only a keyword (no table). !search 
	  <keyword> is equivalent to !search all <keyword>.
	- POE implemented with a lot of minor internal changes and cleanup
	- Handle kills appropriately (for now, we will reconnect... this is 
	  probably bound to change)
	- Added debug flag to toggle debug output on/off
	- Print a list of users when joining a channel
	- Altered behaviour of search mechanism. !search <keyword> is now 
	  equivalent to !search all <keyword>
	- Anna^ sets mode +i on successful connect from now on.
	- When parsing messages, handle [ ,:-] (space, comma, colon, dash) as
	  possible nick/message separators.
	- Logging: Anna^ can now log stuff to logfiles. ~/.anna/logs/anna.log 
	  logs main bot events, while activity in respective channels are 
	  logged as  network/#channel.log. The same goes for privmsgs.
	  Logging can be controlled from the config-file (see docs for more 
	  info)
	- Session-handling. It is now possible to register with Anna^. 
	  Registered users can be voiced or opped or made bot admins (grants
	  additional rights to control Anna^) See docs for more info.
	  On first-run, Anna^ will let you create a root-user for the bot.
	- Anna^ makes a backup-copy of the database, before attempting an 
	  upgrade.
	- The escape_shell()-function have been abandoned in favour of perls 
	  builtin qx()
	- Bugfix: Anna^ no longer uses any hardcoded paths for the database
	- Bugfix: Anna^ only attempts to parse a config-file, if the 
	  permissions are correct. In the future, we might throw a warning when
	  permissions are wrong.
	- Bugfix: handle quits/parts with empty statements without warnings.
	- Bugfix: missed param in on_topic
	- Bugfix: handle parts without a message
	- Bugfix: nix'd warning in googlesearch
	- Bugfix: on first run, don't attempt to connect to the database 
	  before  it's copied over
	- Bugfix: make !lart me work properly again
	- Misc. minor bugfixes
