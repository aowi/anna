TODO for module-refactoring:
* Implement support for binding regexps
  * Add support for specifying flags
* Implement support for binding to specific events
* Implement onload-routine that is called when a module is loaded
* --||-- onunload, onwhatelse?
* Dynamic module-loading (that is, allow admins to issue 'load foo' to load 
  module foo)
  For the time being, the loading-stuff is working, but has to be called 
  manually from anna.pl. 
* Flesh out a sane interface for module-building 
* Take a look at the eggdrop interface
  http://www.eggheads.org/support/egghtml/1.6.18/tcl-commands.html
  Anna should load all modules from core/ and auto/ pr. default, when starting.
  
  Perhaps we should make a loader-module, that takes care of from-irc-loading. 
  This should  be a core-module that binds the load-command, and then issues 
  Anna::Module::load after rights-checking and the like.

* EXTENSIVE TESTING OF MODULE-RELATED FAILURES (e.g. modules crashing, failing 
  to compile, doing funky stuff when loaded, issuing 'die' at weird times and 
  so on).

* Move existing stuff into modules

Misc
----
Improve nickserv support to allow custom commands or something like that.
