Read this before you start picking at the internals of Anna^

Coding style
------------
* No tabs, use four spaces instead
  If you use vim, consider setting a modeline at the top of the file:
  # vim: et:ts=4:sw=4

* No newline before opening braces of methods/functions
  Ie. use "sub foo {" rather than 
  sub foo
  {
  The same goes for opening braces of hashes, arrays and anything else.

* Please remove trailing whitespace
* Keep comments on a separate line

Documentation
-------------
* All internal modules (ie. stuff in the lib/ dir) must be documented
  in POD. It doesn't matter whether it is inlined with the source, or
  at the very end of the module.

* Bot modules need not have POD documentation, but it is generally 
  advisable to include it. If you do so, keep in mind that it is meant
  for developers - not end users.
