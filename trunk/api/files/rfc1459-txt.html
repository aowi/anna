<td class=ContentSection valign=top><div class=CGeneric id=MainTopic><div class=CTopic><h1 class=CTitle><a name="channel_topics_are*NOT*exchanged_here_because_the_TOPIC"></a>channel topics are *NOT* exchanged here because the TOPIC</h1><div class=CBody><p class=CParagraph>command overwrites any old topic information, so at best, the two sides of the connection would exchange topics.</p><p class=CParagraph>By passing the state information about servers first, any collisions with servers that already exist occur before nickname collisions due to a second server introducing a particular nickname.&nbsp;  Due to the IRC network only being able to exist as an acyclic graph, it may be possible that the network has already reconnected in another location, the place where the collision occurs indicating where the net needs to split.</p><p class=CParagraph>8.7 Terminating server-client connections</p><p class=CParagraph>When a client connection closes, a QUIT message is generated on behalf of the client by the server to which the client connected.&nbsp;  No other message is to be generated or used.</p><p class=CParagraph>8.8 Terminating server-server connections</p><p class=CParagraph>If a server-server connection is closed, either via a remotely generated SQUIT or &lsquo;natural&rsquo; causes, the rest of the connected IRC network must have its information updated with by the server which detected the closure.&nbsp;  The server then sends a list of SQUITs (one for each server behind that connection) and a list of QUITs (again, one for each client behind that connection).</p><p class=CParagraph>8.9 Tracking nickname changes</p><p class=CParagraph>All IRC servers are required to keep a history of recent nickname changes.&nbsp;  This is required to allow the server to have a chance of keeping in touch of things when nick-change race conditions occur with commands which manipulate them.&nbsp;  Commands which must trace nick changes are:</p><ul class=CBulletList><li>KILL (the nick being killed)</li><li>MODE (+/- o,v)</li><li>KICK (the nick being kicked)</li></ul><p class=CParagraph>No other commands are to have nick changes checked for.</p><p class=CParagraph>In the above cases, the server is required to first check for the existence of the nickname, then check its history to see who that nick currently belongs to (if anyone!).&nbsp;  This reduces the chances of race conditions but they can still occur with the server ending up affecting the wrong client.&nbsp;  When performing a change trace for an above command it is recommended that a time range be given and entries which are too old ignored.</p><p class=CParagraph>For a reasonable history, a server should be able to keep previous nickname for every client it knows about if they all decided to change.&nbsp;  This size is limited by other factors (such as memory, etc).</p><p class=CParagraph>8.10 Flood control of clients</p><p class=CParagraph>With a large network of interconnected IRC servers, it is quite easy for any single client attached to the network to supply a continuous stream of messages that result in not only flooding the network, but also degrading the level of service provided to others.&nbsp;  Rather than require every &lsquo;victim&rsquo; to be provide their own protection, flood protection was written into the server and is applied to all clients except services.&nbsp;  The current algorithm is as follows:</p><ul class=CBulletList><li>check to see if client&rsquo;s `message timer&rsquo; is less than current time (set to be equal if it is);</li><li>read any data present from the client;</li><li>while the timer is less than ten seconds ahead of the current time, parse any present messages and penalize the client by 2 seconds for each message;</li></ul><p class=CParagraph>which in essence means that the client may send 1 message every 2</p><p class=CParagraph>seconds without being adversely affected.</p><p class=CParagraph>8.11 Non-blocking lookups</p><p class=CParagraph>In a real-time environment, it is essential that a server process do as little waiting as possible so that all the clients are serviced fairly.&nbsp;  Obviously this requires non-blocking IO on all network read/write operations.&nbsp;  For normal server connections, this was not difficult, but there are other support operations that may cause the server to block (such as disk reads).&nbsp;  Where possible, such activity should be performed with a short timeout.</p><p class=CParagraph>8.11.1 Hostname (DNS) lookups</p><p class=CParagraph>Using the standard resolver libraries from Berkeley and others has meant large delays in some cases where replies have timed out.&nbsp;  To avoid this, a separate set of DNS routines were written which were setup for non-blocking IO operations and then polled from within the main server IO loop.</p><p class=CParagraph>8.11.2 Username (Ident) lookups</p><p class=CParagraph>Although there are numerous ident libraries for use and inclusion into other programs, these caused problems since they operated in a synchronous manner and resulted in frequent delays.&nbsp;  Again the solution was to write a set of routines which would cooperate with the rest of the server and work using non-blocking IO.</p><p class=CParagraph>8.12 Configuration File</p><p class=CParagraph>To provide a flexible way of setting up and running the server, it is recommended that a configuration file be used which contains instructions to the server on the following:</p><ul class=CBulletList><li>which hosts to accept client connections from;</li><li>which hosts to allow to connect as servers;</li><li>which hosts to connect to (both actively and passively);</li><li>information about where the server is (university, city/state, company are examples of this);</li><li>who is responsible for the server and an email address at which they can be contacted;</li><li>hostnames and passwords for clients which wish to be given</li></ul><p class=CParagraph>access to restricted operator commands.</p><p class=CParagraph>In specifying hostnames, both domain names and use of the &lsquo;dot&rsquo; notation (127.0.0.1) should both be accepted.&nbsp;  It must be possible to specify the password to be used/accepted for all outgoing and incoming connections (although the only outgoing connections are those to other servers).</p><p class=CParagraph>The above list is the minimum requirement for any server which wishes to make a connection with another server.&nbsp;  Other items which may be of use are:</p><ul class=CBulletList><li>specifying which servers other server may introduce;</li><li>how deep a server branch is allowed to become;</li><li>hours during which clients may connect.</li></ul><p class=CParagraph>8.12.1 Allowing clients to connect</p><p class=CParagraph>A server should use some sort of &lsquo;access control list&rsquo; (either in the configuration file or elsewhere) that is read at startup and used to decide what hosts clients may use to connect to it.</p><p class=CParagraph>Both &lsquo;deny&rsquo; and &lsquo;allow&rsquo; should be implemented to provide the required flexibility for host access control.</p><p class=CParagraph>8.12.2 Operators</p><p class=CParagraph>The granting of operator privileges to a disruptive person can have dire consequences for the well-being of the IRC net in general due to the powers given to them.&nbsp;  Thus, the acquisition of such powers should not be very easy.&nbsp;  The current setup requires two &lsquo;passwords&rsquo; to be used although one of them is usually easy guessed.&nbsp;  Storage of oper passwords in configuration files is preferable to hard coding them in and should be stored in a crypted format (ie using crypt(3) from Unix) to prevent easy theft.</p><p class=CParagraph>8.12.3 Allowing servers to connect</p><p class=CParagraph>The interconnection of server is not a trivial matter: a bad connection can have a large impact on the usefulness of IRC.&nbsp;  Thus, each server should have a list of servers to which it may connect and which servers may connect to it.&nbsp;  Under no circumstances should a server allow an arbitrary host to connect as a server.&nbsp;  In addition to which servers may and may not connect, the configuration file should also store the password and other characteristics of that link.</p><p class=CParagraph>8.12.4 Administrivia</p><p class=CParagraph>To provide accurate and valid replies to the ADMIN command (see section 4.3.7), the server should find the relevant details in the configuration.</p><p class=CParagraph>8.13 Channel membership</p><p class=CParagraph>The current server allows any registered local user to join upto 10 different channels.&nbsp;  There is no limit imposed on non-local users so that the server remains (reasonably) consistant with all others on a channel membership basis</p><p class=CParagraph>9.&nbsp; Current problems</p><p class=CParagraph>There are a number of recognized problems with this protocol, all  of which  hope to be solved sometime in the near future during its rewrite.&nbsp;  Currently, work is underway to find working solutions to these problems.</p><p class=CParagraph>9.1 Scalability</p><p class=CParagraph>It is widely recognized that this protocol does not scale sufficiently well when used in a large arena.&nbsp;  The main problem comes from the requirement that all servers know about all other servers and users and that information regarding them be updated as soon as it changes.&nbsp;  It is also desirable to keep the number of servers low so that the path length between any two points is kept minimal and the spanning tree as strongly branched as possible.</p><p class=CParagraph>9.2 Labels</p><p class=CParagraph>The current IRC protocol has 3 types of labels: the nickname, the channel name and the server name.&nbsp;  Each of the three types has its own domain and no duplicates are allowed inside that domain.&nbsp; Currently, it is possible for users to pick the label for any of the three, resulting in collisions.&nbsp;  It is widely recognized that this needs reworking, with a plan for unique names for channels and nicks that don&rsquo;t collide being desirable as well as a solution allowing a cyclic tree.</p><p class=CParagraph>9.2.1 Nicknames</p><p class=CParagraph>The idea of the nickname on IRC is very convenient for users to use when talking to each other outside of a channel, but there is only a finite nickname space and being what they are, its not uncommon for several people to want to use the same nick.&nbsp;  If a nickname is chosen by two people using this protocol, either one will not succeed or</p><p class=CParagraph>both will removed by use of KILL (4.6.1).</p><p class=CParagraph>9.2.2 Channels</p><p class=CParagraph>The current channel layout requires that all servers know about all channels, their inhabitants and properties.&nbsp;  Besides not scaling well, the issue of privacy is also a concern.&nbsp;  A collision of channels is treated as an inclusive event (both people who create the new channel are considered to be members of it) rather than an exclusive one such as used to solve nickname collisions.</p><p class=CParagraph>9.2.3 Servers</p><p class=CParagraph>Although the number of servers is usually small relative to the number of users and channels, they two currently required to be known globally, either each one separately or hidden behind a mask.</p><p class=CParagraph>9.3 Algorithms</p><p class=CParagraph>In some places within the server code, it has not  been  possible  to avoid  N^2  algorithms  such  as  checking  the channel list of a set of clients.</p><p class=CParagraph>In current server versions, there are no database consistency checks, each server assumes that a neighbouring server is correct.&nbsp;  This opens the door to large problems if a connecting server is buggy or otherwise tries to introduce contradictions to the existing net.</p><p class=CParagraph>Currently, because of the lack of unique internal and global labels, there are a multitude of race conditions that exist.&nbsp;  These race conditions generally arise from the problem of it taking time for messages to traverse and effect the IRC network.&nbsp;  Even by changing to unique labels, there are problems with channel-related commands being disrupted.</p><p class=CParagraph>10.&nbsp;
